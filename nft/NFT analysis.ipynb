        "A couple of months ago, an article in Nature was published that maps 6.1 million transactions between June 2017 and April 2021 obtained primarily from Ethereum and WAX blockchains. It is an exciting article that analyzes the statistical properties of the market as well as some network characteristics. The authors also made the underlying NFT transaction dataset available under the CC-BY 4.0 license.\n",
        "Transactions can be described as links between the traders, so what better way to represent the data than a graph. First, Michael Hunger and I imported the dataset into Neo4j, a native graph database. Then I performed a simple exploratory graph analysis to better understand the underlying dataset, which I will demonstrate in this blog post.\n",
        "Setting up the environment\n",
        "First, you need to download and install the Neo4j Desktop application. The dataset is available as a database dump, which you can download by clicking this link. You need to copy the file to the Neo4j Desktop files folder and then select Create new DBMS from dump.\n",
        "\n",
        "It is advisable to choose the latest version of the Neo4j database available. Next, you will also need to install the APOC and GDS libraries.\n",
        "\n",
        "As this is a slightly larger dataset, increasing the heap and page cache memory allocation is also recommended. I chose 4GB of memory for heap allocation and 2GB for the page cache.\n",
        "\n",
        "Congratulations, you have successfully prepared the Neo4j environment.\n",
        "## Graph schema model\n",
        "\n",
        "The dataset revolves around transactions between traders. Each transaction has a date and the price in crypto and USD. As this is a dataset of NFT transactions, each transaction describes which NFT was sold. Interestingly, an image URL is available for most NFTs so that you can inspect the image sold on the internet. Some of the NFTs have up to four available image URLs for redundancy. We also know if an NFT is a part of a collection and which category it belongs to.\n",
        "## Exploratory graph analysis\n",
        "Now we can begin with the exploratory graph analysis. As always, I have prepared a Jupyter notebook that contains all the queries in this post.\n",
        "First, we will evaluate the number of nodes and relationships with the `apoc.meta.stats` procedure."

        "What a strange coincidence that both transactions were executed on the same day, only around 19 hours in between. The buyers and sellers seem unrelated, although the address that contains all zeroes caught my eye. After some investigating, I've learned that when someone mints an NFT on the OpenSea platform, the null address always shows up as a creator. On the other hand, you could also send an NFT to the null address to effectively delete the NFT. At least that's why some of the posts on the internet claim. After I put on my Sherlock Holmes hat, I found the NullAddress profile on OpenSea, where you can buy NFTs from them. This left me even more confused as I would assume that selling an NFT to the null address would effectively burn the NFT token, but who would send a 7.5 million USD worth NFT to burn it. Perhaps I just misunderstood it all, as this is my first analysis of the NFT ecosystem, and I have no prior knowledge of it. In any case, it all seems a bit suspicious. The two transactions have an identical price and were executed on the same day. I've checked if the three addresses have any transactions between each other, but the dataset contains no such transactions.\n",

        "It seems that Cryptopunk were (are?) the most lucrative tokens. For example, a user bought the Cyptopunk 3011 NFT on the 12th of March 2021 at 700 thousand USD and then resold it a good month later for 1.7 million USD. That is a good deal for a pixel image of a dude smoking a pipe. Now, you might say why would someone sell an NFT for 700 thousand when they could get a million more, but here is the catch. That person bought it for 16 thousand USD in October 2020 and sold it in March 2021 for 700 thousand. So effectively, the price of the NFT went 100x from October 2020 to March 2021.\n",

The direction of the relationship will indicate the flow of the money, while the weight will represent the volume. We will use the Cypher Projection to project a virtual network that is a transformed version of the underlying stored graph."
