    "# Limitations of text embeddings in RAG applications\n",
    "## And how to overcome them using knowledge graphs and structured tools\n",
    "\n",
    "Everyone loves text embedding models, and for good reason — they excel at encoding unstructured text, making it easier to discover semantically similar content. It’s no surprise that they form the backbone of most RAG applications, especially with the current emphasis on encoding and retrieving relevant information from documents and other textual resources. However, there are clear examples of questions one might ask where text embedding approach to RAG applications falls short and delivers incorrect information.\n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, text embeddings are great at encoding unstructured text. On the other hand, they aren’t that great at dealing with structured information and operations such as filtering, sorting, or aggregations. Imagine a simple question like:\n",
    "\n",
    "_What is the highest-rated movie released in 2024?_\n",
    "\n",
    "To answer this question, we must first filter by release year, followed by sorting by rating. We’ll examine how a naive approach with text embeddings performs and then demonstrate how to deal with such questions. This blog post showcases that when dealing with structured data operations such as sorting, filtering, or aggregating, you need to use tools different from text embeddings.\n",
    "\n",
    "The code is available on GitHub.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Environment setup\n",
    "In this blog post, we will use the [recommendations project in Neo4j Sandbox](https://sandbox.neo4j.com/?usecase=recommendations). The recommendations project uses the MovieLens dataset, which contains movies, actors, ratings, and more information.\n",

    "The results are definitely not helpful here as we get returned four random movies. It’s virtually impossible to get from these random four movies to conclusion that there are a total of 1000 movies we tagged and embedded for this example\n",
    "\n",
    "So, what’s the solution? It’s straightforward: questions involving structured operations like filtering, sorting, and aggregation need tools specifically designed to operate with structured data.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tools for structured data\n",
    "At the moment it seems that most people think about the text2query approach, where an LLM generates a database query to interact with a database based on the provided question and schema. For Neo4j specifically this is text2cypher, but there is also text2sql for SQL databases. However, it turns out in practice that it isn’t reliable and not robust enough for production use.\n",

    "\n",
    "You can use techniques like chain of thought, few-shot examples, or fine-tuning, but achieving high accuracy remains nearly impossible at this stage. The text2query approach works well for simple questions on straightforward database schemas, but that’s not the reality of production environments. To address this, we shift the complexity of generating database queries away from an LLM and treat it as a code problem where we generate database queries deterministically based on function inputs. The advantage is significantly improved robustness, though it comes at the cost of reduced flexibility. It’s better to narrow the scope of the RAG application and answer those questions accurately, rather than attempt to answer everything but do so inaccurately.\n",
    "\n",
    "Since we are generating database queries — in this case, Cypher statements — based on function inputs, we can leverage the tool capabilities of LLMs. In this process, the LLM populates the relevant parameters based on user input, while the function handles retrieving the necessary information. For this demonstration, we will first implement two tools: one for counting movies and another for listing them, and then create an LLM agent using LangGraph.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Tool for counting movies\n",
    "We will being by implementing a tool for counting movies based on predefined filters. First, we have to define what those filters are and describe to an LLM when and how to use them."
